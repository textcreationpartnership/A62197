            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Epistle Dedicatory to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of the <hi>FRENCH.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SINCE the Sale of Paintings by Auction is grown so fashionable, I thought the Picture of a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> might be no unacceptable Curiosity to some Persons. It is an Original, I assure you, and drawn as near to the Life as a Limner could take the Features of one danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Rigadoon;</hi> for, the <hi>French,</hi> like the Sea, are perpetually in Motion.</p>
            <p>When the Sword is drawn, 'tis not fit the Pen should lie Idle; the tenderest hand on board a Vessel, must lend its assistance in case of a Leak, and I think it the Duty of every Man to arm against the Common Enemy.</p>
            <p>It is not unknown by what Arts the
<pb facs="tcp:105200:3"/>
               <hi>French</hi> have gain'd so great a Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>England;</hi> with the Gentlemen they can Insinuate, and Flatter the Ladies better than the thick Skull'd <hi>English;</hi> for, were there a Court consisting of but one single Person of each Country in the Æ²ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, the <hi>French</hi> Man would stand the fairest Candidate for the Office of Master of the Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>Oh the Vertues of Shrug and Grimace, and the Charms of loud Laughter! <hi>Clark,</hi> the Posture-master, never knew half so many Distortions of Body, as they do; only the difference is this, his he acquired by Labour, and theirs is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to 'em.</p>
            <p>An honest blunt Freedom of Speech and Carriage, has by our modern Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so much of the Clown in it, that <hi>Irish</hi> breeding has not more; but to be tickled to Death with Complements, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the finest way of dying that can be.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:105200:3"/>
            <p>By these various Arts of Flattery, the <hi>French</hi> are grown into Esteem: And, I am the rather confirm'd in the Truth of my Opinion, because I heard a Woman of Quality once say, â€” <hi>That an ordinary</hi> French <hi>Footman had more Breeding and Civility, than an</hi> English <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He who can calmly hear his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen so vilified, without some Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deserves better to be toss'd in a Blanket, than the Mayor of <hi>Scarbrough.</hi> For, with <hi>Asper,</hi> in a Play of <hi>Ben Johnson</hi>'s, it becomes every <hi>English</hi> Man to say,
<q>
                  <l>

                  <hi>Shall I to Honour; or to Love give way?</hi>

               <l>Their Tongues not only wag, but Hands and Feet.</l>
               <l>Each part about them seems to move and walk;</l>

               <l>With such a noise they fill each others Ears;</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Dover</hi> Courtâ€”all speak, and no Man hears,</l>
               <l>Their various Arts of Dress we next survey,</l>
               <l>In which they bear so very great a sway:</l>
               <l>All <hi>Europe</hi> to their Fashions bends the Knee,</l>
               <l>In that they 've gain'd the <hi>Æ²niversal Monarchy.</hi>

                  <hi>Oh Custom, Custom!</hi> how dost thou prevail?</l>
               <l>Make us neglect the Head, but dress the Tail.</l>
               <l>Their Modes so strangely alter humane Shape,</l>
               <l>What Nature made a Man, they make an Ape.</l>

               <l>They taught our Sparks to strut in <hi>Pantaloons,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And look as fiercely as the <hi>French Dragoons:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>They made 'em cut off Ornamental Hair,</l>
               <l>A damn'd long <hi>cherdreux Periwig</hi> to wear.</l>
               <l>For which the Wearer is respected more</l>
               <l>Than for grey Hairs and baldness heretofore.</l>
               <l>A Dress thought Ominous in former Time,</l>
               <l>Till a <hi>French</hi> Patent authoriz'd the Crime.</l>
               <l>No Gloves but those from <hi>Blois</hi> will fit our Hand,</l>
               <l>Our <hi>English</hi> Kid we cannot understand:</l>
               <l>Our Home-made Lace we do not think is fine,</l>

               <l>As th' Plague of Flies in <hi>Aegypt</hi> heretofore;</l>
               <l>Wriggle in great Mens Ears, and hunt about</l>
               <l>To find a merited Preferment out:</l>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:105200:16"/>
               <l>While needy Worth, and bashful Merit starves;</l>
               <l>And he's alone unhappy that deserves</l>
               <l>A better Usage from the Hand of Fate.</l>
               <l>No wonder 'tis that Fools are fortunate:</l>
               <l>Their Confidence, their want of Wit supplies;</l>
               <l>He's born to be a Wretch who will be wise.</l>
               <l>Thy Satyr, <hi>Oldham,</hi> would have scar'd 'em more</l>
               <l>Than did our Arms their Fathers heretofore.</l>
               <l>Happy would he be could a Vessel find,</l>
               <l>From hence they'd fly as swift as thought or wind,</l>
               <l>And leave not one poor <hi>Vallet</hi> here behind.</l>
               <l>But ah! in vain their absence we implore,</l>
               <l>So very well they love the <hi>English</hi> Shore;</l>
               <l>As soon they'd go to <hi>China</hi> or <hi>Japan,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>As willingly return to <hi>France</hi> again:</l>
               <l>Though Nature has with Plenty blest their Soil,</l>
               <l>They dare not taste of that for which they toil.</l>
               <l>No wonder then our <hi>Canaan</hi> they preferr,</l>
               <l>Before there fordid Entertainment there.</l>
               <l>But hold, methinks I hear a Person prate,</l>

               <l>Thanks to the Author of this good Advice;</l>
               <l>But pity in Extremes becomes a Vice:</l>

               <l>If Charity and Alms I must allow,</l>
               <l>I'll be inform'd to whom, and when, and how.</l>
               <l>I never yet could find the Law commands</l>
               <l>Me fire my House, to warm by-standers Hands.</l>
               <l>Besides, what Gratitude have they repaid,</l>
               <l>For all the kind Civilities they've had?</l>
               <l>If to debauch our Court, and spoil our Trade</l>
               <l>Be suitable returns for Favours past,</l>
               <l>I think indeed we're paid in full at last:</l>
               <l>And he must have no Choler or no Brains,</l>
               <l>Who, thinking on our two last Monarch's Reigns,</l>
               <l>Against the <hi>French</hi> his just Resentment spares.</l>
               <l>The first of these, who lov'd to feel no Cares,</l>
               <l>But lead a Life of Softness mixt with Ease:</l>
               <l>With Presents of <hi>French</hi> Mistresses they please.</l>

               <l>These <hi>Dalilahs</hi> his Bosom Secrets knew,</l>
               <l>And had the Cunning to improve 'em too.</l>
               <l>What Mind can phansy, or what Pen rehearse</l>
               <l>The Ruines done by these Smock-Privateers?</l>
               <l>These Female Frigats did more Mischiefs scatter,</l>
               <l>By their low tire of Guns 'twixt wind and water,</l>
               <l>Than could the Fleet in Eighty-eight have done,</l>
               <l>Had they effected what they had begun,</l>
               <l>And with Success had push'd their Fortune on.</l>
               <l>To build their Ships the <hi>French</hi> our Timber bought,</l>
               <l>Which with such Pride upon the Ocean float;</l>
               <l>And like their Makers Minds are still in Motion,</l>
               <l>Whiles <hi>Lewis</hi> Glories in the empty Notion,</l>
               <l>Of being stil'd, <hi>The Neptune of the Ocean.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Hearing his Name, my <hi>Satyr</hi> boyls with Rage,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>Firebrand</hi> of the Age,</l>
               <l>Whom Nature in an angry Humour hurl'd</l>
               <l>Down as a fit Fiend to vex the Christian World:</l>
               <l>So much he of Hells Malice does partake,</l>
               <l>He Mischief purely does for Mischiefs sake.</l>
               <l>So exquisitely bad, so prone to evil,</l>
               <l>He seems not like, but surely is the Devil:</l>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:105200:18"/>
               <l>For humane Wit could never so deceive,</l>
               <l>Nor Princes of their Sences so bereave,</l>
               <l>To make them contrary to known sworn Laws,</l>
               <l>Hoodwink'd to second his most Hellish Cause.</l>
               <l>This the <hi>Æ²nhappy James</hi> but knows too late;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>James,</hi> who was once the Brave and Fortunate;</l>
               <l>Belov'd at Home, and much esteem'd Abroad,</l>
               <l>While he in Honours Paths securely trod:</l>
               <l>But leaving them for some new uncouth ways,</l>
               <l>His Subjects Ruines, and himself betrays;</l>
               <l>Still he with Glory might have fill'd the Throne,</l>
               <l>If by <hi>French</hi> means he had not plainly shown</l>
               <l>Their Interest was much dearer than his own.</l>
               <l>The Injur'd <hi>Leopold</hi> may next complain,</l>
               <l>While <hi>Spire</hi> and <hi>Worms,</hi> besides a num'rous train</l>
               <l>Of other Towns in heaps of Ruins bear</l>
               <l>The favours of a <hi>French</hi> perfidious War;</l>
               <l>Nor does the <hi>Duke of Savoy</hi> want his share.</l>
               <l>Had <hi>Fistula in ano</hi> been but kind,</l>

               <l>The Peace of <hi>Christendom</hi> had been secur'd,</l>
               <l>And not have felt those ills she since endur'd.</l>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:105200:18"/>
               <l>Of what great Actions do they vainly boast,</l>
               <l>Done by their <hi>Fleet</hi> upon our <hi>British</hi> Coast?</l>
               <l>Not fam'd <hi>Lepanto</hi>'s Fight was talk'd of more,</l>
               <l>Or <hi>Wars of Cyprus</hi> in the Days of yore,</l>
               <l>Than their late silly Action on our Shore.</l>
               <l>Their Cannon beat a little Cottage down,</l>
               <l>And they will swear that they destroy'd a Town.</l>

               <l>Poets have sometimes been Prophetick thought,</l>

               <l>Vainly I wish, tho' fain wou'd be inspir'd,</l>
               <l>Yet with uncommon heat my Breast is fir'd.</l>
               <l>Methinks with an unusual bravery,</l>
               <l>I see our <hi>English Fleet</hi> upon the Sea,</l>
               <l>Directly Sailing for the Coast of <hi>France,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To pay some Favours we receiv'd from thence:</l>
               <l>With <hi>Roman Courage</hi> see our <hi>Souldiers</hi> Land,</l>
               <l>All waiting with impatience the Command;</l>
               <l>While the Confederate Forces all as one</l>
               <l>Unite to pull the Tyrant from his Throne.</l>
               <l>Cursing his Fate, methinks I see him fall,</l>
               <l>And grin to hear the <hi>Furies</hi> for him call.</l>

               <l>But this, you'll say, is like a Madman done,</l>
               <l>To sound a Triumph ere the Fight is won;</l>
               <l>Yet this I care not, did all Mankind know;</l>
               <l>From th' bottom of my Heart I wish it so.</l>
